# 📱 Kosher Aurora Apps List

Welcome! This repository powers the **Kosher Aurora Store** – a filtered and privacy-focused version of Aurora Store tailored for safe, kosher-friendly usage. The store fetches a dynamic app list from this repo, ensuring that only approved apps are available—no updates to the app itself are needed.

---

## 🔍 What’s Different?

You may remember the older **Aurora Updater**—it worked, but this is better:

* ✅ Uses the **latest version** of the Aurora Store
* ✅ Supports **direct app downloads**
* ✅ Dynamically syncs with this JSON list
* ✅ Can install via **root**, **Aurora Services**, or even standard **Package Installer**
* ✅ Tries to **block access to default app settings**, but if users find a way, [please report it](https://github.com/TripleU613/KosherAuroraAppsListJson/issues)

## 📁 JSON-Controlled App List

All app visibility is controlled by a single file: [`apps_list.json`](apps_list.json)

* **No coding required** to contribute—it's like editing a text file.
* Hosted on GitHub, so anyone can help maintain the list.
* Used live by the store to update its allowed apps.

### ✅ Allowed Apps

The rules are simple:

* ❌ No social media
* ❌ No apps with embedded browsers
* ✅ Everything else that's useful or age-appropriate:

  * File managers
  * Utility tools
  * Kid-safe games

## 🧾 JSON Format

Here’s what the format looks like:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "title": "File Managers",
      "packages": [
        "com.example.files",
        "com.example.manager"
      ]

      "packages": [
        "com.kidsgame.mathfun"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## ⚙️ Installation Notes

* **Rooted device?** Enable root install in settings.
* **Aurora Services installed?** It can use that too.
* **No extras?** It will install using the regular Android package installer.
* **Anonymous login only** — that's the only mode allowed in this fork.

## 🧪 Still Experimental

A lot of effort went into blocking access to app settings and preventing workarounds—but nothing’s perfect. If you discover a bypass, please [open an issue](https://github.com/TripleU613/KosherAuroraAppsListJson/issues) so it can be fixed.
